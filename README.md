## Overview

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with systems at atomic and subatomic scales, where classical mechanics no longer provides accurate predictions. These projects use Python and Jupyter notebooks to solve various quantum mechanical problems numerically, allowing users to visualize wavefunctions and energy levels, and better understand how quantum systems behave under different potentials.

## Projects

1. **Electron States Simulation**: This project numerically solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation for different quantum systems, focusing on the calculation of discrete electron states and their energy levels.
   
2. **Quantum Potential Wells**: Investigates the behavior of particles in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional potential wells, highlighting phenomena such as quantum tunneling and bound states in finite wells.

3. **Hermite Polynomials in Quantum Harmonics**: This project focuses on the analytical and numerical solutions to the quantum harmonic oscillator, a cornerstone model in quantum mechanics. Hermite polynomials are utilized as part of the solution to the system's wavefunctions.

4. **Legendre Polynomials in Angular Momentum**: Examines the role of Legendre polynomials in solving the angular part of the Schrödinger equation, particularly in problems involving spherical symmetry such as the hydrogen atom.

5. **Radial Wave Functions for Hydrogen Atom**: In this project, the radial Schrödinger equation is solved to obtain the radial wave functions for the hydrogen atom. These wavefunctions are critical in understanding atomic orbitals and energy distributions.
